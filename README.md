# batten-degree-page

A redesign for the Batten degree page.

I did not have a way to serve ITC Franklin Gothic and Bodoni Poster Italic so some things may not look quite right.

This has been tested in current versions of Firefox and Chrome. IE and edge should work, but may be funky.

A design mockup has been included to help clarify the vision. 

On the index file I largely took the existing Degrees page and added my vision between the header and the existing content. I marked my additions with HTML comments. I added a css file to make those changes so rhea.css is all my code.
