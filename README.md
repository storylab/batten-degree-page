# batten-degree-page

A redesign for the Batten degree page.

I did not have a way to serve ITC Franklin Gothic and Bodoni Poster Italic so some things may not look quite right.

This has been tested in current versions of Firefox and Chrome. IE and edge should work, but may be funky.

A design mockup has been included to help clarify the vision.
